# Guided Practice - Prismatic Books

This activity guides you through building a simple CRUD API using Prisma and Express. It requires a basic understanding of relational database schemas, how to translate them into the equivalent [Prisma schemas](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema), and how to [perform CRUD operations with Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/crud).

The **solution** branch contains documented solution code. The commit history of that branch follows the instructions below.
